# PYGAL - Python Geometric Algorithms Library

The pygal library consists of wrappers for CGAL, one of the most powerful libraries for geometric algorithms. 
However, CGAL is written in C++, compiles like a turtle and is not much fun to use.

The pygal library offers some extremely nice wrappers for python, that harness the speed of C++ and combine it with the beauty of Python. 

The API is not completely stable yet, so use with caution. 

Currently, only 2D types are implemented, but if there is interest and demand, we can go 3D as well!
